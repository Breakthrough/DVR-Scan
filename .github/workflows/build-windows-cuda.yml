# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build opencv-python with CUDA support on Windows
#
# This workflow compiles opencv-python from source with CUDA enabled on a
# GitHub-hosted Windows runner. The resulting Python wheel is then uploaded
# as a build artifact.
#
# This is a complex and long-running process. It is configured to run only
# on manual trigger (workflow_dispatch).
