The installer is recommended for most users.  Windows builds include all required dependencies to run DVR-Scan.  Only 64-bit builds are available.

<h3>CUDA速-Enabled Builds (Experimental)</h3>

Nvidia CUDA速 builds experimental and outdated due to difficulty producing binary distributions covering all systems and GPU architectures. If you require CUDA support, the Python version of DVR-Scan is compatible with any CUDA速 enabled version of the `opencv-python` module.  You can get better performance or use DVR-Scan on a wider variety of GPUs if you build the module on your system, with the latest SDK version.

!!! cuda-download "**1.5.1 (Not Latest)**<span class="dvr-scan-release-date">:fontawesome-solid-triangle-exclamation:</span>"

    <div class="buttongrid buttongrid-download">[:fontawesome-solid-flask: &nbsp; CUDA速 Build `.zip`](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/releases/download/v1.5.1-release/dvr-scan-1.5.1-win64-cuda.zip){ .md-button #changelog-button }</div>

Make sure to set `-b MOG2_CUDA` when running DVR-Scan (e.g. `dvr-scan -i video.mp4 -b MOG2_CUDA`).
