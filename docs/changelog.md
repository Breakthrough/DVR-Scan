----------------------------------------------------------

#### Changelog

### 1.7.0.1 (March 11, 2025)

Re-release of Windows distribution that fixes program hanging when starting scan ([#209](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/209)). This was caused due to the way the program was built. There are no code changes, so the Python distribution has not been re-released.

### 1.7 (February 28, 2025)

#### Release Notes

DVR-Scan 1.7 ships with a completely new UI, and supports faster video decoders (up to 50% better scanning performance):

<img alt="example of region editor" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/releases/1.7/docs/assets/app-main-window.jpg" width="480"/>

The UI can be started by running `dvr-scan-app`, and is installed alongside the existing command line interface `dvr-scan`.  Config settings and region files can be shared seamlessly between both. Feedback on the new UI is welcome.

#### Changelog

 - [feature] New GUI now available across all platforms, can be launched via `dvr-scan-app`
    - Has UI elements for all settings, supports editing motion regions
    - Shows scan progress in real-time

    - Allows switching between `OpenCV` (default), `PyAV`, and `MoviePy` for video decoding
    - Certain backends provide substantial performance benefits, up to 50% in some cases (let us know which one works best!)
 - [bugfix] Fix crash on headless systems that don't have `pillow` installed
 - [general] The region editor no longer prompts for a save path if one was already specified via the `-s`/`--save-regions` option
 - [general] A size-limited logfile is now kept locally, useful for filing bug reports
    - Can be controlled with config file options `save-log` (default: yes), `max-log-size` (default: 20 kB), `max-log-files` (default: 4)
    - Path can be found under help entry for `--logfile` by running `dvr-scan --help` or `dvr-scan-app --help`
 - [general] Minimum supported Python version is now 3.9

## DVR-Scan 1.4

### 1.4.1 (February 20, 2022)

#### Release Notes

This release includes fixes for incorrect event start/end times when using frame skipping, and improvements to the bounding box overlays.

**Important:** Aside from critical bugfixes, DVR-Scan 1.4.x is the last minor version supporting Python 2.7.  Starting from v1.5, the new minimum supported Python version will be 3.6 (see [#83](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/83) for details).

#### Changelog

 * [bugfix] Event start times are now correctly calculated when using `-fs`/`--frame-skip` ([#68](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/68), [#70](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/70))
    * Note that event start/end times may still be off by how many frames are skipped due to loss of context with respect to frame-accurate motion detection
 * [bugfix] Event end times now take into account the number of skipped frames if `-fs`/`--frame-skip` if specified (e.g. it is assumed all skipped frames contained motion)
 * [bugfix] Bounding box smoothing now takes into account `-fs`/`--frame-skip` ([#31](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/31))
 * [bugfix] Bounding boxes now cover all frames with motion ([#31](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/31))
    * In v1.4 only the frames after `-l`/`--min-event-length` frames had passed were covered

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#20](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/20))
 * Using `-st`/`--start-time` will yield incorrect results
 * If a motion event happens to be *exactly* the number of frames specified by `-l`/`--min-event-length`, the end timecode will be displayed incorrectly ([#90](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/90))

----------------------------------------------------------

### 1.4 (February 8, 2022)

#### Release Notes

In addition to several bugfixes, this release of DVR-Scan adds the ability to draw a bounding box around the area in the frame where motion was detected. There are also several improves when using `-fs`/`--frame-skip` and/or `-df`/`--downscale-factor` by ensuring all other option are relative to the original video framerate/resolution.

**Important:** Aside from critical bugfixes, DVR-Scan 1.4.x is the last minor version supporting Python 2.7.  Starting from v1.5, the new minimum supported Python version will be 3.6 (see [#83](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/83) for details).

#### Changelog

 * [feature] Add new `--bb`/`--bounding-box` option to draw rectangle around the area in the video where motion was detected

     * If the `screeninfo` package is installed, or you are using a Windows build, videos will automatically be resized to the maximum screen size
 * [bugfix] Fix frozen timestamp at beginning of video ([#68](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/68))

 * [bugfix] Scanning no longer stops suddenly after a frame fails to decode ([#62](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/62))
     * If more than 1 corrupt frame is found, a warning will be displayed with the number of frame decode failures
     * If more than 5 frames in a row fail to be decoded, processing will stop and display an error
 * [bugfix] When no events have been found, an empty file is no longer created if `-o/--output` is specified
 * [enhancement] `-k`/`--kernel-size` is now relative to the original video resolution, and will be reduced to adjust for `-df`/`--downscale-factor` if set ([#46](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/46))
 * [bugfix] Output videos now have the correct playback speed when using `-fs`/`--frame-skip` by reducing the framerate ([#70](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/70))
 * [bugfix] The `-l`/`--min-event-length` and `-tp`/`--time-post-event` parameters are now adjusted to compensate for `-fs`/`--frame-skip` if set ([#70](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/70))
 * [bugfix] An erroneus event (false positive) is no longer generated at the beginning of a video when `-l`/`--min-event-length` is equal to 1 frame

#### Known Issues

 * Variable framerate videos (VFR) are not fully supported, and will yield incorrect timestamps ([#20](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/20))
 * When using `-fs`/`--frame-skip`, event start times do not include all of `-tb`/`--time-before-event` ([#68](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/68), [#70](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/70))

 * Using `-st`/`--start-time` will yield incorrect results
 * If a motion event happens to be *exactly* the number of frames specified by `-l`/`--min-event-length`, the end timecode will be displayed incorrectly ([#90](https://github.com/Breakthrough/DVR-Scan/issues/90))
