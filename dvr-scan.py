# This is a convenience script mostly intended for development purposes,
# allowing you to call `dvr-scan.py` from the working directory (in addition
# to using `python -m dvr_scan`) to prevent confusion with installed copies.
# Programmatically, this file is identical to the dvr_scan/__main__.py file.
