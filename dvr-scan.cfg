# This file contains all possible DVR-Scan config options.
#
# A config file path can be specified via the -c/--config option.
# DVR-Scan also looks for a `dvr-scan.cfg` file in the following locations:
#
#   Windows: C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Local/DVR-Scan/dvr-scan.cfg
#
#   Linux:   ~/.config/DVR-Scan/dvr-scan.cfg
#            $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dvr-scan.cfg
#
#   Mac:     ~/Library/Preferences/DVR-Scan/dvr-scan.cfg
#
# Run `dvr-scan --help` to see the exact path on your system which will be
# used (it will be listed under the help text for the -c/--config option).
