------------------------------------------------

**Beta Release**: Try the upcoming v1.5 beta (or [download a Windows build](http://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5/download/)):

    pip install dvr-scan[opencv] --upgrade --pre

See [the changelog](https://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5/changelog/) and [updated docs](https://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5/guide/quickstart/).

------------------------------------------------

**Quick Install**: Requires Python modules `numpy`, OpenCV `cv2`, and `tqdm` (optional) for displaying progress.  To install DVR-Scan via `pip` with all dependencies:

    pip install dvr-scan[opencv] --upgrade

Requires ffmpeg for certain features. Windows builds (MSI installer/portable ZIP) can be found on [the download page](http://dvr-scan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/download/).

------------------------------------------------

**DVR-Scan** is a cross-platform command-line (CLI) application that **automatically detects motion events in video files** (e.g. security camera footage).  In addition to locating both the time and duration of each motion event, DVR-Scan will save the footage of each motion event to a new, separate video clip.  Not only is DVR-Scan free and open-source software (FOSS), written in Python, and based on Numpy and OpenCV, it was built to be extendable and hackable.

For users wanting finer control over the output video encoding method, the default timecode format (`HH:MM:SS.nnnn`) is compatible with most popular video tools, so in most cases the motion events DVR-Scan finds can be simply copied and pasted into another tool of your choice (e.g. `ffmpeg`, `avconv` or the `mkvtoolnix` suite).
