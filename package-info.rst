DVR-Scan is a command-line tool that finds motion events in video files (e.g. security camera footage), finding the location and duration of movement in static scenes.  Motion events can be saved as individual videos, or together in a single video, effectively "extracting" only scenes/frames from the input video that contain motion.  Motion event sensitivity can be configured with the `-t` / `--threshold` flag, where lower values are more sensitivity to movement (e.g. requires less motion to trigger an event).
