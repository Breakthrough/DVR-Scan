"""``dvr_scan`` Module

This is the main DVR-Scan module containing all application logic,
motion detection implementation, and command line processing. The
main modules under `dvr_scan` are organized as follows:

  ``cli``: command-line interface

  ``scanner``: scans a video for motion and extracts events

  ``detector``: motion detection algorithms

  ``overlays``: overlays which can be drawn when outputting events

There are also a few helper modules:

  ``video_joiner``: concatenates multiple input videos

  ``opencv_loader``: helper for resolving dynamic libraries used by OpenCV

  ``platform``: library/platform specific helpers
